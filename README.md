# Reuse-Configuration-Using-Terraform-Modules
The configuration files requried for terraform to build the resources.


You need not have to save the module files in your local system, it can be saved in github or even on AmazonS3. Terraform can be configured to fetch the module from these sources. In this project I have configured terraform to read the modules from my modules repository: [AWS-VPC-Modules](https://github.com/sreehariskumar/AWS-VPC-Modules)
